[simpl.info](http://www.simpl.info) is a website for simplest-possible code examples, nothing more. 

I also maintain a [list of resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuhUEiIkAUHO0LBBNM4A1Enc5QgVZn3CDkuSoPZJR1U/edit#) for information about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Your contributions and comments are welcome.

__Building the source: __

```
# After clone
$ cd build 
$ npm install grunt 
$ grunt --feature "new-feature"
$ cd ../"ew-feature" # Go ahead and add what is needed.
```
